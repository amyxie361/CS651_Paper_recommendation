\section{Introduction}

With the rapid publication of scientific literature, conducting a comprehensive literature review has become more challenging. Keeping up with current development of a certain also requires huge effort. However, citation network would help to improve the efficiency and quality when we want to survey on a certain field. Since the citation network is a graph structure, we will explore the new framework \textbf{GraphX}, which makes graph computation easier. The objective of this project is to learn a new framework GraphX and implement network algorithms to accomplish \textbf{paper recommendation}. Our system will recommend users related papers based on input keywords, citation network and reading history.
