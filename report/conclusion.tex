\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

This is conclusion.

Future work:
According to the previous analysis, we could improve the system in several ways. First we can include external TF/IDF score or compute the score according to the whole paper to eliminate problem from the language unicity. In this way, we can acquire better keywords. Second, we can try other valid citation network dataset for more updated data. Also, we can explore other pattern mining method and try different recommendation algorithms. Another very important work should be done is that we have to solve the cold start problem and develop auto evaluation process for unlabeled recommendation problem.
