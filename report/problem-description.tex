\section{Problem Description}
%
We will solve the problem of paper recommendation based on keywords, citation network and user reading history. 
We will have an offline dataset consisting of paper citation relation and papers' content.

Next, we will formally states the input and output of our system. We separate the problem into two part: given the interested keywords then the system output a list of recommending papers, or given a list of read papers in user's history then the system output a list of recommended papers. 

\paragraph{First Part}

For the first part, the input will be a list of $n$ strings $K = [k_1, k_2, ..., k_n]$, where each string is an interested field, e.g. ["machine learning", "computer vision"]. The desired paper list will be $R = [r_1, r_2, ..., r_m]$, in the form of indexs of $m$ papers. Our system will recommend papers in an ordered way, which means $r_i$ is a better paper than $r_{i+1}, \forall i$.

\paragraph{Second Part}

For the second part, the input will be a list of papers $P = [p_1, p_2, ..., p_n]$, where each paper is represented as a unique id, e.g. ["journals/cacm/Szalay08"]. This represents user's reading history ignoring the time sequence. The desired paper list will be $R =  [r_1, r_2, ..., r_m]$, in the form of indexs of $m$ papers. Our system will also recommend papers in an ordered way, which means $r_i$ is a better paper than $r_{i+1}, \forall i$.
