\section{Introduction}

With the increase of scientific literature, conducting a comprehensive literature review has become more challenging. Citation network would improve the efficiency and quality when we want to search for scientific literature. The objective of this project is to apply a new framework GraphX and implement algorithms in order to provide users with matching important papers based on input keywords and recommend related papers to users based on reading history.
