\section{Problem Description}
%
We will solve the problem of paper recommendation based on keywords, citation network and user reading history. 
We will have an offline dataset consisting of paper citation relation and papers' content.

For each query, we have the following as the input and output.
%
\paragraph{Input}
%
\begin{itemize}
%
  \item \textbf{Keywords}: a list of strings where each string is an interested field, e.g. ["machine learning", "computer vision"].
%
  \item \textbf{Reading history (optional)}: a list of papers where each paper is represented as a unique id, e.g. ["journals/cacm/Szalay08"].
%
\end{itemize}
%
\paragraph{Output}
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Recommended papers}: a list of papers in descending recommending order.
\end{itemize}
